# üöÄ Infrastructure GitOps Repository

This repository defines the declarative infrastructure for self-hosted stacks using Docker Compose and Portainer GitOps automation.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) with GitOps support enabled

## üìÅ Folder Structure

```
infra/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stacks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myapp/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
```

Each stack folder contains its own `docker-compose.yaml` and optional `.env` file. These stacks are deployed and updated via Portainer using GitOps.

## üåê Shared Network: `core-network`

Almost all services in this GitOps repository are connected via a common Docker bridge network called `core-network`. This allows containers to communicate with each other across stacks and is required for reverse proxying, database access, and service discovery.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You must create the `core-network` **before deploying any stacks** that depend on it.

### üîß Creating the `core-network`

If you don‚Äôt already have the network, or want to reset it:

```bash
# Remove any existing copy (only do this while all related stacks are stopped)
docker network rm core-network

# Create it again with a custom subnet and gateway
docker network create \
  --driver bridge \
  --subnet 172.20.0.0/16 \
  --gateway 172.20.0.1 \
  core-network
```

This ensures all services can join the same virtual network and communicate by container name (e.g. `mongodb`, `nginx-proxy`, etc.).

> You only need to do this once per host.

## üö¶ GitOps with Portainer

Each stack is configured in Portainer as follows:
- **Git Repository**: This repository's URL
- **Repository Reference**: `refs/heads/main`
- **Path**: e.g. `stacks/myapp`
- **Auto Update**: Enabled (interval or webhook)

Changes to Compose files in this repository will automatically trigger stack updates in Portainer.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Keep each stack self-contained with its own `.env` file if needed
- Avoid committing sensitive data or secrets
- Use meaningful commit messages to track configuration changes
- Test changes locally using `docker-compose` before pushing

## üì¶ Managed Services

This GitOps repository manages the following self-hosted services using Docker Compose and Portainer.

### üì° [Fing Agent](./stacks/fing)
A containerized Fing Agent for local network scanning and device monitoring.

- Uses `fing/fing-agent` image
- Runs with `NET_ADMIN` capability and `host` network mode for low-level access
- Exposes port `44444`
- Persists data in a named volume (`fing-data-volume`)
- Ideal for discovering and tracking devices on your LAN

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [GitHub Runner](./stacks/github-runner)
A self-hosted GitHub Actions runner container for automating CI/CD workflows.

- Uses `myoung34/github-runner`
- Executes jobs for the `quiz` repository
- Requires a GitHub PAT as an environment secret

### üçÉ [MongoDB](./stacks/mongodb)
A containerized MongoDB 8.0 instance for development and local service usage.

- Uses the official `mongo` image
- Exposes port `27017`
- Root credentials loaded via environment secrets
- Persistent data stored in a named volume (`mongodb-data-volume`)
- Connected to external network `core-network`

### üåê [Nginx Proxy](./stacks/nginx-proxy)
An automated reverse proxy with HTTPS support using Let's Encrypt DNS-01 challenges via Cloudflare.

- Uses `nginxproxy/nginx-proxy` and `nginxproxy/acme-companion` images
- Exposes ports 80 and 443
- Automatically issues and renews SSL certificates
- Certificates and ACME data stored in named volumes `nginx-proxy-certs-volume` and `acme-volume`
- Proxies any container using `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` environment variables
